All Linux users are assigned a unique user ID (uid), which is just an integer; 
normal users start with a uid of 1000 or greater.

Linux uses groups for organizing users. Groups are collections of accounts with certain shared permissions. 
Control of group membership is administered through the /etc/group file, which shows a list of groups and their members. 
By default, every user belongs to a default or primary group. When a user logs in, the group membership is set for their 
primary group and all the members enjoy the same level of access and privilege. Permissions on various files and 
directories can be modified at the group level.

Users also have one or more group IDs (gid), including a default one which is the same as the user ID. These numbers are 
associated with names through the files /etc/passwd and /etc/group. Groups are used to establish a set of users who have 
common interests for the purposes of access rights, privileges, and security considerations. Access rights to 
files (and devices) are granted on the basis of the user and the group they belong to.

For example, /etc/passwd might contain george:x:1002:1002:George Metesky:/home/george:/bin/bash and /etc/group might contain george:x:1002.
