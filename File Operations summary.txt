You have completed Chapter 10. Letâ€™s summarize the key concepts covered:

- The filesystem tree starts at what is often called the root directory (or trunk, or /).
- The  Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) provides Linux developers and system administrators 
  a standard directory structure for the filesystem.
- Partitions help to segregate files according to usage, ownership, and type.
- Filesystems can be mounted anywhere on the main filesystem tree at a mount point. 
  Automatic filesystem mounting can be set up by editing /etc/fstab.
- NFS (Network File System) is a useful method for sharing files and data 
  through the network systems.
- Filesystems like /proc are called pseudo filesystems because they exist only in memory.
- /root (slash-root) is the home directory for the root user.

- /var may be put in its own filesystem so that growth can be contained and not fatally affect the system.
- /boot contains the basic files needed to boot the system.
- patch is a very useful tool in Linux. Many modifications to source code and configuration files are 
  distributed with patch files, as they contain the deltas or changes to go from an old version of a file 
  to the new version of a file.
- File extensions in Linux do not necessarily mean that a file is of a certain type.
- cp is used to copy files on the local machine, while rsync can also be used to copy files from one 
  machine to another, as well as synchronize contents.
- gzip, bzip2, xz and zip are used to compress files.
- tar allows you to create or extract files from an archive file, often called a tarball. You can optionally 
  compress while creating the archive, and decompress while extracting its contents.
- dd can be used to make large exact copies, even of entire disk partitions, efficiently.
