Distributions have straightforward graphical interfaces for creating and removing users and groups and manipulating 
group membership. However, it is often useful to do it from the command line or from within shell scripts. 
Only the root user can add and remove users and groups.

Adding a new user is done with useradd and removing an existing user is done with userdel. In the simplest 
form, an account for the new user bjmoose would be done with:

$ sudo useradd bjmoose

Note that for openSUSE, useradd is not in the normal user's PATH, so the command should be:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/useradd bjmoose

which, by default, sets the home directory to /home/bjmoose, populates it with some basic files (copied from /etc/skel) 
and adds a line to /etc/passwd such as:

bjmoose:x:1002:1002::/home/bjmoose:/bin/bash

and sets the default shell to /bin/bash. Removing a user account is as easy as typing userdel bjmoose. 
However, this will leave the /home/bjmoose directory intact. This might be useful if it is a temporary inactivation. 
To remove the home directory while removing the account one needs to use the -r option to userdel.

Typing id with no argument gives information about the current user, as in:

$ id
uid=1002(bjmoose) gid=1002(bjmoose) groups=106(fuse),1002(bjmoose)

If given the name of another user as an argument, id will report information about that other user.
