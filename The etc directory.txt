The /etc directory is the home for system configuration files. It contains no binary programs, 
although there are some executable scripts. For example, /etc/resolv.conf tells the system 
where to go on the network to obtain host name to IP address mappings (DNS). 
Files like passwd, shadow and group for managing user accounts are found in the /etc directory. 
While some distributions have historically had their own extensive 
infrastructure under /etc (for example, Red Hat and SUSE have used /etc/sysconfig), 
with the advent of systemd there is much more uniformity among distributions today.

Note that /etc is for system-wide configuration files and only the superuser can modify 
files there. User-specific configuration files are always found under their home directory.
