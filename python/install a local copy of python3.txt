Building a Local Version of Python
If the Python version you need is not available on the CS systems, it is straightforward to download source code 
and build a local Python interpreter in project space.

Navigate to the Download Python page, navigate to the version of your choice, download the corresponding “XZ 
compressed source tarball,” and put it in a temporary directory in your project space. For example (assuming your project space is at /n/fs/myproject):

 $ mkdir /n/fs/myproject/temp
 $ cd /n/fs/myproject/temp
 $ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.6/Python-3.10.6.tar.xz
Un-tar the tarball and build Python. The --prefix option to the configure script sets the location where Python will be installed. For example:

 $ tar xJf Python-3.10.6.tar.xz
 $ cd Python-3.10.6
 $ ./configure --prefix=/n/fs/myproject/py310
 $ make
Note that you may get output that includes this:

 Python build finished successfully!
 The necessary bits to build these optional modules were not found:
 nis
The nis module is not useful in the CS environment and is deprecated in Python 3.11 and so this warning can be safely ignored.

Install the Python you just built into the location specified by --prefix above:

 $ make install
Your newly build Python interpreter is available in the bin subdirectory of the --prefix path set above:

 $ /n/fs/myproject/py310/bin/python3.10 --version
 Python 3.10.6
(Optional) Remove the source tarball and the build directory.

 $ cd /n/fs/myproject/temp
 $ rm -rf Python-3.10.6.tar.xz Python-3.10.6
