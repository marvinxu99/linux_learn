The mount command is used to attach a filesystem (which can be local to the computer or on a network) somewhere 
within the filesystem tree. The basic arguments are the device node and mount point.  For example,

$ sudo mount /dev/sda5 /home

will attach the filesystem contained in the disk partition associated with the /dev/sda5 device node, 
into the filesystem tree at the /home mount point. There are other ways to specify the partition other 
than the device node, such as using the disk label or UUID.

To unmount the partition, the command would be:

$ sudo umount /home

Note the command is umount, not unmount! Only a root user (logged in as root, or using sudo) has the 
privilege to run these commands, unless the system has been otherwise configured.

If you want it to be automatically available every time the system starts up, you need to 
edit /etc/fstab accordingly (the name is short for filesystem table). Looking at this file will 
show you the configuration of all pre-configured filesystems. man fstab will display how this 
file is used and how to configure it.

Executing mount without any arguments will show all presently mounted filesystems.

The command df -Th (disk-free) will display information about mounted filesystems, including the 
filesystem type, and usage statistics about currently used and available space.

The most common such filesystem is named simply NFS (the Network Filesystem). It has a very long history 
and was first developed by Sun Microsystems. Another common implementation is CIFS (also termed SAMBA), 
which has Microsoft roots. We will restrict our attention in what follows to NFS.
