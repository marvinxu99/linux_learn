Set up a cron job to do some simple task every day at 10 AM. Create a file named mycrontab with the following content:
0 10 * * * /tmp/myjob.sh
      
and then create /tmp/myjob.sh containing:
#!/bin/bash
echo Hello I am running $0 at $(date)
      
and make it executable:
$ chmod +x /tmp/myjob.sh
      
Put it in the crontab system with:
$ crontab mycrontab
      
and verify it was loaded with:
$ crontab -l
0 10 * * * /tmp/myjob.sh
$ sudo ls -l /var/spool/cron/student
-rw------- 1 student student 25 Apr 22 09:59 /var/spool/cron/student
$ sudo cat /var/spool/cron/student
0 10 * * * /tmp/myjob.sh
      
Note you if don't really want this running every day, printing out messages like:
Hello I am running /tmp/myjob.sh at Wed Apr 22 10:03:48 CDT 2015
      
and mailing them to you, you can remove it with:
$ crontab -r
      
If the machine is not up at 10 AM on a given day, anacron will run the job at a suitable time.
