Adding a new group is done with groupadd:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/groupadd anewgroup

The group can be removed with:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/groupdel anewgroup

Adding a user to an already existing group is done with usermod. For example, you would first look at what groups the user already belongs to:

$ groups rjsquirrel
bjmoose : rjsquirrel

and then add the new group:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G anewgroup rjsquirrel

$ groups rjsquirrel
rjsquirrel: rjsquirrel anewgroup

These utilities update /etc/group as necessary. Make sure to use the -a option, for append, so as to avoid removing already existing groups. groupmod can be used to change group properties, such as the Group ID (gid) with the -g option or its name with then -n option.

Removing a user from the group is somewhat trickier. The -G option to usermod must give a complete list of groups. Thus, if you do:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -G rjsquirrel rjsquirrel

$ groups rjsquirrel
rjsquirrel : rjsquirrel

only the rjsquirrel group will be left.
