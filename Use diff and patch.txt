Linux and other open source communities often use the patch utility to disseminate modifications and updates. Here, we will give a practical introduction to using diff and patch.

It would be a good idea to read the man pages for both patch and diff to learn more about advanced options and techniques, that will help one to work more effectively with patch. In particular, the form of patches has a lot to do with whether they can be accepted in their submitted form.

Change to the /tmp directory.
Copy a text file to /tmp. For example, copy /etc/group to /tmp.
dd cannot only copy directly from raw disk devices, but from regular files as well. Remember, in Linux, everything is pretty much treated as a file. dd can also perform various conversions. For example, the conv=ucase option will convert all of the characters to upper-case characters. We will use dd to copy the text file to a new file in /tmp while converting characters to upper-case, as in: student:/tmp> dd if=/tmp/group of=/tmp/GROUP conv=ucase.
According to the man page for patch, the preferred options for preparing a patch with diff are -Naur when comparing two directory trees recursively. We will ignore the -a option, which means treat all files as text, since patch and diff should only be used on text files anyway. Since we are just comparing two files, we do not need to use the N or r options to diff, but we could use them anyway as it will not make a difference. Compare group and GROUP using diff, and prepare a proper patch file.
Use patch to patch the original file, /tmp/group, so its contents now match those of the modified file, /tmp/GROUP. You might try with the --dry-run option first!
Finally, to prove that your original file is now patched to be the same one with all upper-case characters, use diff on those two files. The files should be the same and you will not get any output from diff.



Using diff and patch
For this exercise, you could use any text file, but we will use /etc/group as described.
student:/tmp> cd /tmp
student:/tmp> cp /etc/group /tmp
student:/tmp> dd if=/tmp/group of=/tmp/GROUP conv=ucase
